This peaceful mantra is a popular invocation recited daily by generations of yoga practitioners to seek Lord Shiva's blessing to attain Moksha, the ultimate success in yoga. Shiva is the lord of rhythm and vibration and Om is the ultimate vibration, therefore Shiva is also referred to as Omkara. This mantra emphasizes the wholistic nature of true Yogic pursuit, in which the desires are not to be suppressed rather properly understood and fullfilled so the seeker may progress steadier and quicker on the spiritual path.",
    "How to chant": "This is a sadhaka mantra (practioner's mantra) and should be recited at the beginning of daily yoga practice. Knowing not only its words and pronunciation but also its meaning and significance is crucial to make this a remarkably powerful invocation.",
