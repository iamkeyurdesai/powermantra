    "Significance": "According to yoga scriptures, Om is the most basic, the most primordial, and the most complete sound that there is. Om consists of sounds aaa, ooo, and mmm—three fundamental units of human speech, which form the basis of almost all spoken words across all human languages. In a profoundly relaxed and deep meditative state, the human vocal organ spontaneously generates a vibratory sound similar to Om. All religions have a basic mantra that more or less resembles Om. In Hinduism, Om is so revered and valued that they say the vedas manifested from the mouth of Brahma the creator but Brahma himself manifested from Om! In Bhagavad Gita Krishna prescribes to the seekers of Moksha that they should commence all activities with (intrnal) recitation of Om. The highly celebrated Mandukya Upanishad equates the four states of consciousness (waking, dreaming, sleeping, and samadhi) with the four parts of Om (a, o, m, and the silence) and claims that grasping the true meaning of Om unravels the entire mystery of consciousness.",
    "How to chant": "This mantra should be chanted at the beginning and the end of a meditation or yoga session. When pronoucing Om the sound A should last for 2 units of time, O for 6 units, M for 1 unit, and the silence for 6 units of time. Doing a daily mala of Om (108 repitions) is a simple yet powerful concentration practice. Relecting on the meaning of Om while reciting it first audibly and then mentally is a popular meditation technique as recommended in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.",
