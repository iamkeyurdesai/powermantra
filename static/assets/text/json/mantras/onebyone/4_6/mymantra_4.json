    "significance": "This is a highly revered mantra. It invokes the sun god (Savitr) as the inner light to give us illumination and self-knowledge. Gayatri mantra together with Mahamrityunjaya mantra are thought to yield complete benefits of mantra shakti. This mantra is a must before any knowledge seeking endeavor. Traditionally this mantra is given as part of the threading ceremony right before starting the education of a child.",
    "howto": "This mantra can be chanted anytime and any place, though it is known to yield the highest benefit when chanted during the early morning period (bramha muhurta). It can be chanted in any tune, but the correct vedic pronunciation with svaras can provide noticeably deeper inner experience. All meditators should chant this mantra at the beginning of their meditation session. A common practice is to chant the gayatri mantra 108 times in a single session. This mantra is often used for Purashcharan (the practice of chanting the same mantra 100008 times under the guidance of a spiritual master).",
